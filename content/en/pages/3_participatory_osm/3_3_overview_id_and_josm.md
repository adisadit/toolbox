### Difference between iD and JOSM

There are several ways to edit in OpenStreetMap. The two most commonly used tools and best programs for mapping projects are iD editor and JOSM. This section provides an overview of each tool as well as presentations to be used in trainings. For self-paced materials and guides, visit [LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org).

| Factors  |  iD Editors | JOSM  |
|---|---|---|
| Edit OSM data  |  ✅  |   ✅  | 
| Interface  | Simple  | Quite complex for begineer  |
| Internet connection  |  Requires stable internet connection | Requires stable internet connection  |
| Tagging interface  | Following consistent and simple tagging scheme (i.e. building or road)  | You are able to using default tagging scheme or using your own preset (custom tagging scheme)  |
| Data quality activities |  Can be used for simple data quality fix (i.e. overlapping building or building without tags) | Mostly used by advanced validator because JOSM have lots of data quality tools (I.e. revert changeset, mass fix error/warnings, routing validation, etc)  |
| Mostly HOT uses for  | Mapathons or when you are restricted from installing program on the computer you are using  | Data quality check, processing field data before upload to OSM, organized editing with paid digitizers  |

All participants registered in your Mapathon activities are intermediate mapper who already made an edits more than 3000 changesets. What is the best application to use for this mapathon event, especially if you also have validation activities at the end of your mapathon event?

    a. iD editor

    b. JOSM

**Answer**: 1. B | 2. B
