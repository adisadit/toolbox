### Safety and Security

In accordance with the first protection principle – do no harm – organizations must prioritize safety, especially of refugee populations. In non-camp situations one of the key goals is expanding the amount of protection space available.

The idea of ‘protection space’ does not have a legal definition – it is a concept that means the extent to which a conducive environment exists for people to be respected and their needs to be met. In most situations, protection space is not static, but expands and contracts over time according to changes in the political, economic, social and security environments.

Each context is so different that it is difficult to make specific recommendations for safety. Communities and organizations conducting mapping activities should establish contingency plans to address the different types of security incidents that may occur. Team members should coordinate all responses to such incidents so as to safeguard the rights and well-being of local community members, and ensure that staff members and volunteers are not put at risk.

For operations, the key to effective safety and security management is the creation of a culture of security. Each staff member and volunteer has a responsibility for their own safety and security, and that of other team members.
