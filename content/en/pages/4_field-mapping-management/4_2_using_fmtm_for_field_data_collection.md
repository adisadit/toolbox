## Learning Activities

Field Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM) is a platform that helps project managers to organize and manage mapping tasks. It assigns those tasks to volunteers/surveyor and tracks their progress.

As a field user, you will heavily uses FMTM to select the grid, download the QR code, and mark grid as done (if you complete the task).

### Working with FMTM Site

1. Go to [fmtm.hotosm.org](https://fmtm.hotosm.org/), you will see list of projects created in FMTM. In order to start working on the project on FMTM, you need to create an account first,
2. Click on **Sign-up** to create a new account with your email address. If you already have an account, click **Sign-in**

4. You will be directed to the project overview page. Select the task/grid that **Ready** to map

- **READY** means that task is available to be mapped
- **LOCKED FOR MAPPING** means that task is already being mapped by another volunteer and therefore unavailable for mapping
- **READY FOR VALIDATION** means that task has been completely mapped and ready to be validated.
- **LOCKED FOR VALIDATION** means that task has been mapped and being validated.
- **VALIDATED** means that task has successfully been validated and completely mapped with no errors
- **MORE MAPPING NEEDED** means that task did not pass the validation process and needs more mapping

5. After you select the task, press **START MAPPING** to lock the task and to ensure no one work on the same area as you.

6. Scan the QR Code or download the QR Code by press the download button on the bottom left side.
7. Use the QR code to start mapping the selected task using the ODK Collect app on your mobile phone (if you do not know on how to operate ODK Collect to load the QR Code, [please check this tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lVMcZ6wvcht1IYvEY7j6iYOgi7idLzX0ODZjp403qJ8/edit))

### Marking the Task as Completed
