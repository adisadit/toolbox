**Data Cleaning, Upload, and Quality Assurance** is a critical step in any mapping workflow. This process covers cleaning raw field data for errors and mistakes, uploading clean data to OpenStreetMap, and using various quality control tools to monitor data that has been uploaded. Regardless of how (and if) you are collecting field data, any project that results edits in OpenStreetMap should have a quality assurance and control plan. 

* **6.1 Management of Collected Data** covers the best practices and recommend workflows for managing data that is collected in the field. 
* **6.2 Data Cleaning and Validation Workflows** provides examples of technical workflows used by HOT in the field for various types of projects. 
* **6.3 Data Cleaning in JOSM** covers the process and steps required to clean field data and the uploading process using JOSM. 
* **6.4 Quality Assurance Tools** provides a guide to tools HOT uses for monitoring and checking data quality of data uploaded to OpenStreetMap. 

If your project... <br>
* Involves field data collection using OpenMapKit and/or OpenDataKit, start with section 6.1. 
* Does not involve field data collection using OpenMapKit and/or OpenDataKit, jump ahead to section 6.4.
